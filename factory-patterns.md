# Factory patterns

## Factory Design Pattern

factory design paatern separates responsibility/detail for creating an instance and from the class that uses the instance

factory pattern looking from a domain/business class

* use abstract class or interface with factory ethoid to create "product"
* use 2nd abstract class or interface to interact with product

factory pattern looking from the class to be created & used which create concrete class for both abstract classes or interfaces
