# Builder pattern

The Builder Pattern uses multiple simple objects built step by step into a complex object. This type of design pattern is a creation pattern, which provides an optimal way to create objects.&#x20;

For example, if you go to KFC, the burger, coke, fries, wings, etc. are constant, but the combinations are frequently changed to produce the so-called "combo".

separates the construction object from the details of its representation or component objects

* often used to acomplex object e.g a Composite or object composed of mult objects&#x20;

basic approach:

* user uses Director class: order and use of build instructions
* ConcreteBuilder: creates the complex object
* Director can change build instructions: to obtain different types of objects
* can change the ConcreteBuilder: to build same type of object differently which means different "materials"

similar to Factory pattern because Factory often used for creating simple objects but Builder pattern is more flexible which may make use of mult Factory classes
